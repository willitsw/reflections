What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the framework for version control with git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows what files will be included in a commit. It is valuable because you should only commit a logical change, and so you might not always want to commit everything, or just one file.
