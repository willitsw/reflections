How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It compares two files and lists just the sections that have changes, making the work much faster than looking by hand.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you ever need to go back and fix something, or go back and work from an earlier state, it would make things much easier.
